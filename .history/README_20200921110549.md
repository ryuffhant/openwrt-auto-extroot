# OpenWRT/LEDE Image Generator

It's a script to generate build a customized OpenWRT firmware image on a Linux x86_64 host
(basic familiarity with [OpenWRT](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner)
is assumed) using image builder.

Generated firmware image support for **exroot** also strip **IPv6, PPOE** and without `LuCI`.
For more information about set up please follow this instruction [extroot](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot). Unfortunately there's little that can be done at that point to ask the user for confirmation.
